# Doom-SNESMusic
SNES-Style soundtracks for Doom, Doom2 and Plutonia [and more :P]

- This compliation is a mix of SPC and MP3 format. SPCs are the files ripped directly from SNES!Doom, and the MP3s are all SNES-Soundfont remixes by Patricio Herrera @ https://www.youtube.com/user/MrPatoHerrera12 & https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4CDB1255F9294609
- MP3s fill in for the Doom 1 tracks for D_E2M1, D_E3M3, D_VICTOR & D_BUNNY.
- MP3s are also used for ALL of Doom 2's music, since there was never a Doom 2 for SNES [again, the music is a SNES-Style soundfont used for the remixes]
- Plutonia uses only music from Doom 1 and 2 combined, and no unique music, hence I made a playlist for it as well.
- TNT: Evilution's music is designed by "Merry Genesis" (@ https://www.youtube.com/user/killkenny5000 ) but "D_DM2TTL" and "D_READ_M" are still unaccounted for.
